On-Page SEO Interview Questions and Answers
1. What is On-Page SEO?

Answer: On-Page SEO refers to the optimization of individual web pages to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. It involves optimizing content, HTML source code, meta tags, headings, internal links, and URL structures.

Example: Optimizing a blog post by including target keywords in the title tag, meta description, and throughout the content while ensuring the page loads quickly and is mobile-friendly.

2. How do you optimize a title tag for SEO?

Answer: To optimize a title tag, ensure it includes the target keyword, is within 50-60 characters, and is both descriptive and engaging to encourage clicks.

Example: For a page targeting "best running shoes," an optimized title tag could be "Best Running Shoes 2024 | Top Picks for All Runners."

3. What is a meta description, and why is it important?

Answer: A meta description is a brief summary of a webpage's content that appears in search engine results. While it doesn’t directly impact rankings, a well-crafted meta description can improve click-through rates.

Example: For the same "best running shoes" page, a meta description might be: "Discover the top-rated running shoes of 2024. Perfect for marathon runners, beginners, and every stride in between."

4. How would you optimize a URL for SEO?

Answer: A good URL is short, descriptive, and includes the target keyword. It should be easy to read for both users and search engines.

Example: Instead of example.com/category/post-12345, use example.com/best-running-shoes.

5. What are header tags (H1, H2, H3), and how do you use them in SEO?

Answer: Header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) are used to define the headings and subheadings on a page. They help structure content and signal to search engines the importance of each section.

Example: For a blog post about running shoes:

H1: Best Running Shoes of 2024
H2: Top Features to Consider
H3: Cushioning
6. What is keyword cannibalization, and how can you avoid it?

Answer: Keyword cannibalization occurs when multiple pages on a website target the same or similar keywords, causing them to compete against each other in search results. This can dilute the effectiveness of your SEO efforts.

Solution: Conduct a content audit to identify and consolidate similar content into one authoritative page, or refine each page's focus to target different keyword variations.

7. How do you optimize images for SEO?

Answer: Optimize images by using descriptive file names, adding alt text with relevant keywords, compressing the image size for faster loading, and using responsive images to ensure they display correctly on all devices.

Example: For an image of a blue running shoe, the file name could be blue-running-shoe.jpg, and the alt text could be "Blue running shoe for marathon training."

8. What is internal linking, and why is it important?

Answer: Internal linking refers to linking one page of your website to another. It helps search engines understand the structure of your website and distributes page authority across your site. It also guides users to related content.

Example: If you have a blog post about running shoes, you might link to another post about “Best Running Techniques” using anchor text like "Check out our guide on the best running techniques."

9. How would you handle a page with a high bounce rate?

Answer: To reduce bounce rate, analyze the content to ensure it matches user intent, improve page load speed, make the design more engaging, and add clear calls-to-action or internal links to encourage further exploration.

Example: If a page on running shoes has a high bounce rate, you might add more interactive elements like videos, enhance the content, or provide clearer links to related articles.

10. How do you measure the effectiveness of your on-page SEO efforts?

Answer: Effectiveness can be measured using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to track metrics such as organic traffic, bounce rate, average session duration, click-through rates (CTR), and keyword rankings.

Example: If you optimize a page for “best running shoes,” you’d monitor the increase in organic traffic to that page, its ranking position for the keyword, and any changes in user engagement metrics.
